# Number Analysis Tool

A simple and elegant web application that performs statistical calculations on five user-input numbers. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this tool provides instant calculations for sum, average, and maximum value with a clean, user-friendly interface.

## 🚀 Features

- **Sum Calculation**: Computes the total of all five numbers
- **Average Calculation**: Calculates the mean value (displayed with 2 decimal places)
- **Maximum Value**: Identifies the largest number among the inputs
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Clean UI**: Modern interface with box shadows, rounded corners, and smooth animations
- **Real-time Results**: Instant calculations with a single button click

## 🖥️ Demo

Enter five numbers and click "Calculate" to see:
- Total sum of all numbers
- Average value (mean)
- Maximum number from the set
